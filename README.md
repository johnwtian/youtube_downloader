#### Description:
YouTube downloader (using pytube and argparse)
Inspired by https://github.com/tuomaskivioja/3-Simple-Python-Projects

This is a command line program that downloads Youtube videos to your computer! Given a YouTube URL or file with multiple URLs, the downloader will use pytube to download each. 

The motivation (and a great use case for this tool) is to download YouTube videos for later viewing. You could use this tool to download videos before your next flight!

There are two options for running the program in the command line. The most functionality is supported via command line arguments. An alternative option is using the simpler guided input prompts to provide filename/links.

TODOs:
- Implement variable resolution download support
- Testing/making alternate output path input easier
- Refactoring main function to more discrete chunks
